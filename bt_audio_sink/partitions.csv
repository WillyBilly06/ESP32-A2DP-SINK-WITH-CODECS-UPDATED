# Recovery partition (Bluedroid BLE OTA-only firmware)
# This partition is used for recovery mode when button is pressed at boot
# Uses "ota_2" subtype (0x12) so bootloader can boot into it when requested
# On fresh flash, OTA data points to ota_0, so this won't be auto-booted
# Size: 1MB (0x100000) - needed for Bluedroid with A2DP compiled in
